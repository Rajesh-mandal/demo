Subject = Request to extend work form home for 1 month.

Hello All,

I need 1 more month to work from home, because i have to stay 1 more
month currently where i am staying now.
Actually my room owner is not allowing me to vaccate the room. they are saying that you have to inform 3 month before vacating the room or else they will deduct three month rent from my deposit amount. i tried to convince the owner they are agreed with 2 month so 1 month is over now and 1 more month is remaining, then only they will return my deposit amount. and also travelling from my location(Kanakpura Road) to office will take very long time around 2 hour to reach office. 
Rightnow i am not in condition to loose money and also I have little financial problem in my home so i cannot afford pg near by office and pay two places rent. 

It will be very helpful if you give permission to work from home for 1 more month.
